Wrapper Offline Remastered  is gonna get patch updates

patch 1 Wrapper Offline Remastered i'll be using Wrapper offline 1.2.3 stable core but remove voiceforge voices & add zimmertheme and add sticky businnes & business models themes too..
patch 2 Wrapper Offline Remastered I'll remove business themes but the version 2.5 is final using the same core cuz i never update...

I created this all the way back ðŸ”™ in August of 2021 for the 1.0 but i deleted 1.0 but kept 2.0 
Cuz it's most used than 1.0. that's why this long project never update.. after 2.5.
