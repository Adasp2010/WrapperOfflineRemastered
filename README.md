Wrapper Offline Remastered  is gonna get patch updates

patch 1 Wrapper Offline Remastered i'll be using Wrapper offline 1.2.3 stable core but remove voiceforge voices & add zimmertheme and add sticky businnes & business models themes too..
patch 2 Wrapper Offline Remastered i'll be using a cool logo and use a 1.3.0 core that might get a true importing but the static of the old one might be kept in.. to install patch 2 update you need to get node.js v17.6.0 cuz it might be Working + Verbose Mode Is Enabled By Deafult so no localhost refused issues..
patch 3 update might have a core from official 2.0.0 core when it's not pre-release build of Wrapper offline
